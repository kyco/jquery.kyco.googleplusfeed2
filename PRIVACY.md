General Information (Information Gathering and Usage)
-----------------------------------------------------

The [kyco Google+ feed widget](https://github.com/kyco/jquery.kyco.googleplusfeed2) retrieves a user's
information via the provided Google+ ID.

The Google+ ID that gets passed to invoke the plugin does not get stored in our database or anywhere on
our hosting provider's storage systems. Neither is any user information stored or gathered for any purposes
whatsoever.

The plugin connects to the Google+ API with the kyco API key and retrieves publicly available
user information from the provided Google+ ID. It retrieves the user's public activity (i.e. Google+ posts)
and the user's public profile (used to display the name and image of the provided ID). Neither of this
information is used or gathered by kyco.


Cookies
